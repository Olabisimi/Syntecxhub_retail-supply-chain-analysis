End-to-end retail supply chain analysis using Python to evaluate revenue performance, profitability, supplier efficiency, and regional trends.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail supply chain dataset to evaluate product performance, profitability, supplier efficiency, logistics stability, and regional sales trends.
The objective is to generate actionable business insights and strategic recommendations using Python-based data analysis.

# Business Problem
Retail management wants to understand:
Which products generate the most revenue and profit?
How supplier performance affects operations?
Whether inventory levels align with demand?
Which regions drive the strongest performance?
How defect rates and lead times impact profitability?
The goal is to support data-driven strategic decisions.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains product-level operational and sales information including:
Revenue Generated
Product Type
Stock Levels
Lead Times
Shipping Costs
Manufacturing Costs
Supplier Name
Defect Rates
Customer Demographics

The dataset was cleaned, validated, and prepared for analysis using pandas.

# Key KPIs
Total Revenue: 577,604.86
Total Units Sold: 46,099
Average Order Value: 5,776.05
